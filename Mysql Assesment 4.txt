Exercise 1
Problem Statement:
Write a query to display trainer_id and batch_id details in such a way that we get all possible combinations of trainer IDs and batch IDs.
Hint: Use Trainer_Info and Batch_Info tables.

Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the records from all columns of tables associate_status and batch_info, wherever the batch_id in the two tables matches.
Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the associate IDs of the associates tagged to trainers and all the trainer IDs irrespective of whether there are any associates tagged to them or not. Hint: Use associate_status and trainer_info tables.
Note: Use Left Outer Join

 
Solution:-

Subqueries
SELECT Trainer_Id
 FROM Associate_Status
 WHERE Associate_Id IN (SELECT Associate_Id
 FROM Associate_Info
 WHERE Associate_Name like ‘%I%’) ;
SELECT Trainer_Id
 FROM Associate_Status
 WHERE Associate_Id IN (SELECT Associate_Id
 FROM Associate_Info
 WHERE Associate_Name not like ‘%I%’) ;
SELECT Trainer_Id , Trainer_Rating
 FROM Trainer_Feedback
 WHERE Trainer_Id IN (SELECT Trainer_Id
 FROM Associate_Status
 WHERE Module = ‘J2EE’) ;
SELECT Name , Registration_Number
 FROM Table
 WHERE Registration_number in (SELECT max(marks)
 FROM Table
 WHERE subject = ‘EI05IP’) ;
SELECT Name , Registration_Number
 FROM Table
 WHERE Registration_number in (select Registration_number
from Table
Where sub=‘E1051P’
order by marks desc limit 1,1;
) ;

Joins

SELECT a.Trainer_Id, b.Batch_Id
FROM Trainer_Info a
CROSS JOIN Batch_Info b
SELECT Associate_Status.*., Batch_Info.*
FROM Associate_Status
FULL OUTER JOIN Batch_info 

ON Associate_Status.Batch_Id=batch_Info.Batch_Id
SELECT Trainer_Info.Trainer_Id, Associate_Status.Associate_ID

LEFT JOIN Associate_Status
